All makers, designers, experts in business, artists, engineers, strategists: all of you are creative.

Yes you.

Different disciplines emphasis different aspects of making yet we share some common concerns.

## Everyone Makes

Get the ideas out. Test them at all stages.

Use all stages of creative effort.

From concept to final form.

## Everyone Shares

Share purpose, common intent,

Share well

## Everyone Collaborates

Work with not for

Perspective taking

## Everyone Cares

Care about your team

Care about your app

Care about the ecosystem

## In all concerns

Check assumptions

Make choices based on feedback, expertise, policy, or any context that drives or affects what you're making, why you're making it, who you're making it for, and how you're making it.

Seek and offer input and critique. Fresh perspective is gold.

**Making products and services** is far more **complex** and can carry much **meaning** beyond a simple sales transaction. A common

Broken assumption of control


Thinking and doing aren't separate


Go choose principles.

Draw attention

Focus on the flower of collaboration

Many factors impede collaboration. Many of which can be alleviated or lessened by communication and shared intent.

Business means something being traded. We don't mean the us and them. We are business people and we are .....

- engaging in commerce (trade of funds, resources, or attention)

To observe and consider the complexity, explore the ecosystem of the businesses that provide you means to see this document.

To observe and consider the meaning, think about something you use that you love.

Making and sharing the services that bring about good products...

Don't hide in the hierarchy.



 between a client and provider of service.



Desire to serve with your skills

Expect and contribute toward a shared sense of purpose.

The words do matter. The code does matter. The aesthetics matter. It all matters.

The trick is to bring about systems and not be frozen.

Holistic: consider a variety of perspectives and techniques to gather information. Use you brain and use your gut. Team up with someone that uses their gut. Make more informed design, engineering, and business decisions.

To make usable, useful, and healthy, systems, services, and products requires a variety of skills, perspectives, brought together with intention.

This is not a method, magic solution, or strict guide. Whether you're looking for such an approach or are weary of methodology dogma and ready to toss them all aside, I ask you to consider these questions and proposition:

Do you work with people or for them?

Do you imagine, fund, design, build, or support products that feel broken?

Have you had the need for feedback but went with an assumption due to barriers to getting good feedback?

Have you ever had useful feedback?

You are a collaborator. Work with and seek a variety of perspectives,

Put down the methods that don't work and ask yourself why. Hold yourself accountable for where you choose to invest your time.

When you see

Make products and services that suck so that you can make and serve ones that don't suck.

TODO: simple paragraphs

The worst thing we can do is to be passive and complacent.

Then again, perhaps the worst thing is when groups of people use the same words with different meanings and only succeed in talking past one another.

NOTE: super early thoughts in this section.

Communication is critical in every aspect of what we build and share.

Practice expressing your assumptions.

Correctness and fitness for purpose cannot be judged well until you begin testing your assumptions that frame your intent.

Some creative practices focus on exploring and expressing concepts, some focus on making functioning prototype and iterating, others focus on high correctness where the shared expression is only one that passes expert practitioners intense scrutiny.

Pick one, pick a few, pick any and all creative approaches that fit your context.

No matter which approach you choose, be sure to collaborate and hold yourself accountable to understanding and communicating your understanding of what you're seeking to make, for what audience/users and their goals, for what business/provider and goals, along with the constraints of your chosen platform, tools, techniques, and skills to work toward those goals.

# The Make, Share, Collaborate Manifesto

Version 0.3

Collaborate. Hold yourself accountable to understanding and communicating your understandings of what you're seeking to make:

    - with what audience and their goals,
    - with what business and goals,
    - with the constraints of your chosen platform, tools, techniques, and skills to work toward those goals.

All makers, designers, experts in business, artists, engineers, strategists:

When groups of people use the same words with different meanings or without a shared intention they only succeed in talking past one another. Work stagnates, users get poor experiences. Poor collaboration leads to living in bubbles of assumption that isolate us from making well informed products.

To remedy this, put down the methods that don't work and ask yourself why. Hold yourself accountable for where you choose to invest your time.

Take a stand for: communication, accountability, and shared purpose.

Seek and test assumptions.

Assumptions aren't inherently bad - With assumptions in hand, you can explore hypotheses and ways to test those hypothesis.

Communication is critical in every aspect of what we build and share.

Use or invent a flow of creative habits, engineering, and communication.

When you collaborate with shared purpose and shared understanding, you're ready individually and as a team to intentionally refine a concept or make the product that embodies the concept.

## Everyone Makes

-  Across the whole team, get the ideas out, assumptions are among the ideas and need to be collected.
-  Everyone explores and critiques ideas at all stages.
-  Value the work and evidence of how it is suited over the role that shares the evidence.

## Everyone Shares

-  Share purpose, common intent. Know why this group of people is together making a thing.
-  Share well across the whole team and with external users: accessible, usable. Collaborate with transparency.
-  Iterate with trust!

## Everyone Collaborates

-  Work with not for.
-  Perspective taking is critical.
-  **Respect and integrate across disciplines** Different disciplines emphasis different aspects of making yet we share some common concerns.

## Everyone Cares

-  Care about your team
-  Care about your app
-  Care about the ecosystem
-  Care about results, deliver over document

## Everyone Critiques

-  Learn the goals of the business and users, advocate for both
-  Describe the design constraints involved in creating the product
-  Recommend alternatives to consider
-  Evaluate those alternatives
-  Use evidence gathered via qualitative and quantitative methods to inform critical exploration

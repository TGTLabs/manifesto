# The Make, Share, Collaborate Manifesto

Version 0.2

All makers, designers, experts in business, artists, engineers, strategists:

Take a stand for: communication, accountability, and shared purpose.

Collaborate and hold yourself accountable to understanding and communicating your understanding of what you're seeking to make, for what audience/users and their goals, for what business/provider and goals, along with the constraints of your chosen platform, tools, techniques, and skills to work toward those goals.

When groups of people use the same words with different meanings or without a shared intention they only succeed in talking past one another. Work stagnates, users get poor experiences. Poor collaboration leads to living in bubbles of assumption that isolate us from making well informed products.

To remedy this, put down the methods that don't work and ask yourself why. Hold yourself accountable for where you choose to invest your time.

Assumptions aren't inherrently bad - they need to be converted to research questions and hypothesis.  Correctness and fitness for purpose cannot be judged well until you begin testing your assumptions that frame your intent. With assumptions in hand, you can explore hypotheses and ways to test those hypothesis.

Communication is critical in every aspect of what we build and share. Put this flow of creative, engineering, and communication to use and you will see an immediate effect on your team's shared purpose, shared understanding, and readiness to refine a concept or make the product that embodies the concept.



## Everyone Makes

-  Across the whole team, get the ideas out, assumptions are among the ideas and need to be collected.
-  Everyone explores and critiques ideas at all stages.
-  Value the work and evidence of how it is suited over the role that shares the evidence.

## Everyone Shares

-  Share purpose, common intent. Know why this group of people is together making a thing.
-  Share well across the whole team and with external users: accessible, usable. Collaborate with transparency.
-  Iterate with trust!

## Everyone Collaborates

-  Work with not for
-  Perspective taking

## Everyone Cares

-  Care about your team
-  Care about your app
-  Care about the ecosystem


**When of us are thinking and doing making with empathy, we make better things.**

## TBD notes

Taking a stand against: being uncommunicative, avoiding accountability, and hiding in a hierarchy.

Assumptions permeate.

Create with a shared purpose.

**Respect and integrate across disciplines** Different disciplines emphasis different aspects of making yet we share some common concerns.

**Embrace creative iteration**, enourage rough drafts.

**Use evidence to inform design**,

We intuitively and through experience know that by working together with empathy and

Some creative practices focus on exploring and expressing concepts,

some focus on making functioning prototype and iterating, others focus on high correctness where the shared expression is only one that passes expert practitioners intense scrutiny.

Pick one, pick a few, pick any and all creative approaches that fit your context.

No matter which tools and techniques you choose, be sure to collaborate and hold yourself accountable to understanding and communicating your understanding of what you're seeking to make, for what audience/users and their goals, for what business/provider and goals, along with the constraints of your chosen platform, tools, techniques, and skills to work toward those goals.

What evidence of this? In order to make any aspect of a system or product, you and your team need to ship some capability to some audience.

The worst thing we can do is to be passive and complacent.

Then again, perhaps the worst thing is when groups of people use the same words with different meanings and only succeed in talking past one another.

## Call to Action

* Express and check assumptions
* Make choices based on feedback, expertise, policy, or any context that drives or affects what you're making, why you're making it, who you're making it for, and how you're making it.
* Seek and offer input and critique.

Draw attention

Focus on the flower of collaboration

Many factors impede collaboration. Many of which can be alleviated or lessened by communication and shared intent.

To observe and consider the complexity, explore the ecosystem of the businesses that provide you means to see this document.

To observe and consider the meaning, think about something you use that you love.

Making and sharing the services that bring about good products...

Don't hide in the hierarchy.

between a client and provider of service.

Desire to serve with your skills

Expect and contribute toward a shared sense of purpose.

The words do matter. The code does matter. The aesthetics matter. It all matters.

The trick is to bring about systems and not be frozen.

Holistic: consider a variety of perspectives and techniques to gather information. Use you brain and use your gut. Team up with someone that uses their gut. Make more informed design, engineering, and business decisions.

This is not a method, magic solution, or strict guide. Whether you're looking for such an approach or are weary of methodology dogma and ready to toss them all aside, I ask you to consider these questions and proposition:

Do you work with people or for them?

Do you imagine, fund, design, build, or support products that feel broken?

Have you had the need for feedback but went with an assumption due to barriers to getting good feedback?

Have you ever had useful feedback?

You are a collaborator. Work with and seek a variety of perspectives,

When you see

Make products and services that suck so that you can make and serve ones that don't suck.

The worst thing we can do is to be passive and complacent.

Then again, perhaps the worst thing is when groups of people use the same words with different meanings and only succeed in talking past one another.

NOTE: super early thoughts in this section.

Practice expressing your assumptions.

build something of quality

be credible

adhere to it

hold ourselves accountable

.... note: bewary of jumping into too much structure too fast
